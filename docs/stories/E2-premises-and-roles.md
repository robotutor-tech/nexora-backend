This epic delivers multi-tenant premises creation and role assignment.

> Status legend:
> - ✅ **DONE**: Implemented in code and wired for use.
> - 🟡 **PARTIAL**: Some pieces exist, but not fully wired / missing key behaviours.
> - ❌ **NOT DONE**: Not implemented or currently commented out.

## Current implementation status (repo check)
- Premises endpoints exist: `context/premises/interfaces/controller/PremisesController.kt`.
- IAM role/resource authorization endpoints exist: `context/iam/interfaces/controller/AuthorizationController.kt`.
- “View assigned premises with pagination + search” was not found as a dedicated API; existing `GET /premises` takes `premisesIds` as input.
