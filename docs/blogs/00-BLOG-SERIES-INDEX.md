## 🎯 How to Read This Series

### For Beginners
Start with **Part 1** to understand core concepts, then move through the series sequentially.

### For Experienced Developers
If you're familiar with DDD, jump to specific chapters based on your needs:
- **Fixing coupling issues?** → Chapter 10 (Anti-Corruption Layer)
- **Query explosion?** → Chapter 5 (Specification Pattern)
- **Business rules scattered?** → Chapter 6 (Policy Pattern)
- **Cross-context transactions?** → Chapter 12 (Saga Pattern)

### For Architects
Focus on **Part 3** (Strategic Patterns) and **Part 5** (Real-World Implementation).

## 🏗️ Running Example: SmartHome Hub Platform

Throughout this series, we'll use **SmartHome Hub** - a smart home automation platform - as our running example:

**Domain Concepts:**
- **User** - Person using the platform
- **Premises** - Physical location (home, office)
- **Device** - IoT device (sensor, actuator)
- **Feed** - Data point from/to device
- **Automation** - Rules for device automation
- **Actor** - User in context of a Premises
- **Zone** - Logical grouping (e.g., "Living Room")

**Bounded Contexts:**
- **User Management** - User registration, profiles
- **Authentication** - Login, tokens, security
- **Device Management** - Device registration, health
- **Automation** - Rules, triggers, actions
- **IAM** - Authorization, roles, permissions

This real-world example will help you understand how DDD patterns solve actual problems.

## 🎓 Prerequisites

To get the most from this series, you should be familiar with:
- **Kotlin** (or Java/C# - concepts translate)
- **Spring Boot** (or any DI framework)
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Basic design patterns**

No prior DDD knowledge required!

## 💡 Why This Series is Different

Most DDD tutorials show trivial examples like "Order" and "Customer". This series uses a **real production IoT platform** with:

✅ **Real complexity** - Multi-tenant, reactive, event-driven  
✅ **Real problems** - Coupling, query explosion, scattered rules  
✅ **Real solutions** - Production-ready code, not toy examples  
✅ **Real trade-offs** - When to use patterns, when not to
